Scorpion, predatory arachnid of the order Scorpiones, is one of the most dangerous animals in the world. Scorpions have eight legs, 
and are easily recognized by a pair of grasping pincers and a narrow, segmented tail, often carried in a characteristic forward curve 
over the back and always ending with a stinger. 3,300 humans die per year in the result of getting bitten by a scorpion. Scorpions primarily 
prey on insects and other invertebrates, but some species hunt vertebrates. They use their pincers to restrain and kill prey, or to prevent their 
own predation. The venomous sting is used for offense and defense. The vast majority of species do not seriously threaten humans, and healthy adults 
usually do not need medical treatment after a sting. About 25 species (fewer than one percent) have venom capable of killing a human, which happens 
frequently in the parts of the world where they live, primarily where access to medical treatment is unlikely.
